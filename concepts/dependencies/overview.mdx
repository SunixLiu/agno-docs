**Dependencies** is a way to inject variables into your Agent or Team Context. `dependencies` is a dictionary that contains a set of functions (or static variables) that are resolved before the agent or team runs.

<Note>
You can use dependencies to inject memories, dynamic few-shot examples, "retrieved" documents, etc.
</Note>

## Basic usage

You can reference the dependencies in your agent instructions or user message.

```python dependencies.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    dependencies={"name": "John Doe"},
    instructions="You are a story writer. The current user is {name}."
)

agent.print_response("Write a 5 second short story about {name}")
```

<Tip>
You can set `dependencies` on `Agent`/`Team` initialization, or pass it to the `run()` and `arun()` methods.
</Tip>


## Using functions as dependencies

You can specify a callable function as a dependency. The dependency will be automatically resolved by the agent/team at runtime.

Take a look at the following example where we use a function to get the top stories from HackerNews:

```python add_dependencies_to_context.py
import json
from textwrap import dedent

import httpx
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat


def get_top_hackernews_stories() -> str:
    """Fetch and return the top stories from HackerNews.

    Args:
        num_stories: Number of top stories to retrieve (default: 5)
    Returns:
        JSON string containing story details (title, url, score, etc.)
    """
    # Get top stories
    stories = [
        {
            k: v
            for k, v in httpx.get(
                f"https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{id}.json"
            )
            .json()
            .items()
            if k != "kids"  # Exclude discussion threads
        }
        for id in httpx.get(
            "https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json"
        ).json()[:num_stories]
    ]
    return json.dumps(stories, indent=4)


agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    # Each function in the dependencies is evaluated when the agent is run,
    # think of it as dependency injection for Agents
    dependencies={"top_hackernews_stories": get_top_hackernews_stories},
    # Alternatively, you can manually add the context to the instructions
    instructions=dedent("""\
        You are an insightful tech trend observer! 📰

        Here are the top stories on HackerNews:
        {top_hackernews_stories}\
    """),
    markdown=True,
)

# Example usage
agent.print_response(
    "Summarize the top stories on HackerNews and identify any interesting trends.",
    stream=True,
)
```

<Check>
Dependencies are automatically resolved when the agent is run.
